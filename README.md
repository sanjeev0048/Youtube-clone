3. Replace the mock upload with actual API calls
4. Add video storage (cloud storage, local server)

For persistent data storage:

1. Choose a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. Create video metadata schema
3. Implement CRUD operations
4. Add user authentication

### Additional Features

   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
